# MIDIclothes

Velocity sensitive MIDI drum pads that can be mounted to clothing that connect to an Arduino.

The Arduino code is designed to work with piezoelectric sensors and originally intended for use with 3D printed wearable sensor housings and a wearable Arduino enclosure. 

Adding the library "MIDI Library" is required for the Arduino Code.
